Hash tables with ordered access, like Python's dictionaries, facilitate faster sorting due to several inherent properties:

1. **Direct Access with Ordering**: Ordered hash tables maintain the order of insertion or a sorted order of keys, allowing for quick retrieval in the desired order.
2. **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**: Hash tables offer average-case constant time, O(1), for insertions and deletions. When combined with ordering mechanisms, the overhead of maintaining order is minimized.
3. **Reduced Sorting Overhead**: Since the data is already maintained in an ordered structure, the need for a full sorting operation is reduced. Accessing elements in order can be done in linear time, O(n).

These properties of ordered hash tables reduce the overall complexity and time required for sorting, leveraging their structural efficiencies to facilitate faster operations.

### Python Dictionaries
In Python, the built-in dictionary (map) is implemented using a hash table. Starting from Python 3.7, the insertion order of keys is guaranteed to be preserved, though this feature was an implementation detail in Python 3.6.

#### Key Characteristics of Python Dictionaries:
1. **Hash Table Implementation**: Python dictionaries use a hash table to provide average-case constant time complexity, O(1), for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
2. **Insertion Order Preservation**: As of Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the order of keys based on their insertion sequence. This is achieved without sacrificing the efficiency of the hash table.
3. **Dynamic Resizing**: The underlying hash table dynamically resizes as elements are added, maintaining efficient access times.
4. **Amortized Operations**: Although resizing the hash table can be costly, these operations are amortized, meaning the average time complexity remains low over a sequence of operations.

This hash table implementation combines efficient average-case performance for common operations with the practical benefit of maintaining insertion order, making Python dictionaries both powerful and user-friendly.
